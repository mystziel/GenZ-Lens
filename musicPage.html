            Five feet to be exact<br>
            You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'<br>
            My body's where they're at<br>
            Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'<br>
            Next to me, one degree of separation<br>
            I heard you're back together and if that's true<br>
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you<br>
            If you want forever, I bet you do<br>
            Just know you'll taste me too<br>
            Uh-huh<br><br>

            He pins you down on the carpet<br>
            Makes paintings with his tongue<br>
            He's funny, now all his jokes hit different<br>
            Guess who he learned that from?<br>
            Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'<br>
            Next to me, one degree of separation<br>
            I heard you're back together and if that's true<br>
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you<br>
            If you want forever, I bet you do (I bet you do)<br>
            Just know you'll taste me too<br><br>

            Every time you close your eyes<br>
            And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine<br>
            And every time you breathe his air<br>
            Just know I was already there<br><br>

            You can have him if you like<br>
            I've been there, done that, once or twice<br>
            And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care<br>
            Yeah, I know I've been known to share<br>
            Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true<br>
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you<br>
            If you want forever, I bet you do (I bet you do)<br>
            Just know you'll taste me too<br><br>

            Taste me too (ow)<br>
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you<br>
            You, no, yeah, uh-uh<br>
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
